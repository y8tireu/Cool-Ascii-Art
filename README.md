## About

ASCII art is the practice of using text characters to represent images or shapes. Because the spacing and alignment of characters are crucial for visual appeal, we recommend following the guidelines below to ensure your ASCII drawings display correctly.

### Guidelines for ASCII Art

- **Use Monospaced Fonts**: In Markdown, code blocks preserve spacing better than normal text. Always wrap your ASCII drawings in triple backticks (```) or use indentation for code blocks.
- **Keep Whitespace Intact**: Leading or trailing spaces can matter. If your ASCII art looks “cropped” or misaligned, check for lost whitespace.
- **Preview Your Changes**: Different editors and Markdown viewers can display characters differently. When possible, preview your art in GitHub (or your preferred platform) to ensure correct alignment.

## How to Use This Repo

- Clone or download the repository.
- Browse the different folders or Markdown files to see various ASCII drawings.
- Use them for inspiration, reference, or incorporate them into your own projects (keeping in mind any license or attribution requirements).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! To add your own ASCII drawing:

1. **Create a New File**: Use a sensible filename (e.g., `castle.md` or `smiley_face.md`).
2. **Wrap Art in Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks so spacing is preserved.
3. **Add a Title & Short Description**: Let others know what your ASCII drawing depicts.
4. **Open a Pull Request**: After you push your changes to a fork, open a PR to merge it back in.

# My Smiley Face Drawing

Here's my attempt at creating a smiley face using ASCII characters!

```
    .-""-.
   / .--. \
  | |    | |
  | |.-""-.|
  | |'----'|
  | |
  \ `-..-' /
   `-....-`
```

- *Explanation*: The smiley is made of a series of ASCII characters forming eyes, nose, mouth, etc.
- Let me know what you think!

## Examples

Below are a few sample ASCII drawings to get you started. Each drawing is placed in a fenced code block to preserve spacing.

### Example 1: House

```  
      /\
     /  \
    /____\
   |      |
   |  []  |
   |      |
   |______|
```

### Example 2: Cat Face

```
|\---/|
| o_o |
 \_^_/
```

### Example 3: Spooky Castle

```
                   .--------.
                  / .------. \
                 / /        \ \
                 | |        | |
                _| |________| |_
              .' |_|        |_| '.
              '._____ ____ _____.' 
              |     .'____'.     |
              '.__.'.'    '.'.__.'
              '.__  |      |  __.'
              |   '.'.____.'.'   |
              '.____'.____.'____.'
              '.________________.'
```

### Tips for Maintaining an ASCII-Focused Repo

- **Preview often**: Ensure that your ASCII art displays correctly in GitHub (or whichever platform you use).
- **Encourage consistent formatting**: Provide guidelines or a style guide if you want consistent headings, spacing, or code block usage.
- **Organize by theme**: If your repo becomes large, consider structuring it by categories (e.g., Animals, Buildings, Logos, etc.) for easier navigation.
- **Invite community**: ASCII artists love to share. Encourage others to submit PRs or issues with new art or improvements!

Enjoy your ASCII adventures!
